<h2>This chocolate fudge was created by Kirstie Allsopp and it's so easy to prepare - as you can see in the step-by-step video. It's great as a family treat, or as a present in little clear bags tied with ribbons.</h2>
<!-- 7. A couple of paragraphs under "Description" that describe the recipe. -->
<p>Each stage is lovely to do because the thick, unctuous, chocolatey mixtures melts into such a tempting and beautiful texture. Once you've made the basic recipe, you can adapt it in any way you'd like. Add in sultanas or chopped cherries, or top the fudge with melted white or dark chocolate, or chopped nuts - see tip for ideas. You can even split the batch into three and make different kinds of fudge so you can gift people a variety. This recipe makes around 60 pieces, so there's plenty for presents (plus some for the chef and any helpers).</p>

  <li>Chop the chocolate into small chunks and place in a non-stick saucepan with the condensed milk and butter, heat very gently, stirring occasionally until melted and smooth.
